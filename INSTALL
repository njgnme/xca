-------------------=[ XCA ]=---------------------

A graphical user interface to OpenSSL.


Requirements:
==============

for compilation, you need the following Libraries:

QT          >=  4.8.0  from http://www.troll.no
OpenSSL     >=  0.9.8  from http://www.openssl.org

GNU C++ compiler >= 3.1.0
GNU make


Installation:
=============

Configuration:
--------------
When cloning the git sources the autoconf configure
script must be assembled by calling
$ ./bootstrap

The officially published sources already come with
a configure script.
To build, just do  the following steps:

$ ./configure; make -j6; make install

You can build in a different subdirectory:
 - cd into the build directory and
 - call configure by its full path.
For example, if you are in the freshly unpacked xca-1.1.0 directory:

$ mkdir Build && cd Build && ../configure && make -j10

To clean all built files: rm -rf Build

If you have a special setup, you can predefine the following
variables: CC, LD, STRIP, CFLAGS, prefix. e.g.:
$ CC="ccache gcc" STRIP=: CFLAGS="-Wall -g" prefix=/opt/xca ./configure
to have a cached build and to not strip xca when installing it.
XCA expects the translationfiles in /opt/xca/share/xca/
and installs itself to /opt/xca/bin/

configure allows to set the openssl and QT installation dir.
$ ./configure --help
shows all options. It writes all found settings to
"Local.mak" and "local.h"


Building:
-----------
The Makefiles do support parallel builds (-j)
targets:
all, xca :  builds the app
install  :  installs the app
headers  :  UICs the headers in ui/ needed by other files.
clean    :  deletes all builded files
distclean:  deletes also Local.mak
xca.exe  :  W32 executable (see INSTALL.w32)
snapshot :  Creates a current snapshot from the local git repository
xca.app  :  Creates the MacOSX xca.app
xca.dmg  :  Creates the MacOSX Disk image

Installing:
------------
make DESTDIR=/my/virtual/root
provides /my/virtual/root/ as root-directory for installation
to be mounted by others as root or as installdir for
package builders.


Running/invoking:

.TP

.SH PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS
The password options accept the same syntax as openssl does:
.TP
.B env:var
Obtain the password from the environment variable var. Since the environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms (e.g. ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.
.TP
.B fd:number
Read the password from the file descriptor number. This can be used to send the data via a pipe for example.
.TP
.B file:pathname
The first line of pathname is the password. If the same pathname argument is supplied to password and sqlpassword arguments then the first line will be used for both passwords. pathname need not refer to a regular file: it could for example refer to a device or named pipe.
.TP
.B pass:password
The actual password is password. Since the password is visible to utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be used where security is not important.
.TP
.B stdin
Read the password from standard input.
